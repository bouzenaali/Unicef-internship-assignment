Algeria,December 2024,"President Tebboune announced pardon of over 2,400 detainees; French-Algerian relations deteriorated further amid accusations against Paris of interference.","Govt announced further releases, although arrests continued. President Tebboune 25 Dec announced pardoning of over 2,400 as yet unnamed detainees, including some convicted of “public order” crimes – charge often used against Hirak movement activists. Moves came after Nov pardons to 4,000 prisoners and raised hopes of release for prominent Algerian-French author Boualem Sansal, arrested in Nov on charges of “attacking the integrity of national territory”; earlier, court 11 Dec rejected appeal against Sansal’s detention. Meanwhile, former presidential candidate and leader of opposition party Front des Forces Socialistes Youcef Aouchiche 14 Dec called on govt to strengthen democratic institutions, advocated for political openness, protection of public freedoms and rule of law. Authorities late Dec, however, started crackdown against online youth activists behind hashtag ManichRadi calling for reform, arresting dozens.

State television 7 Dec broadcast documentary alleging French foreign intelligence agency tried to recruit former Algerian jihadist Mohamed Amine Aïssaoui in March 2023 to spy on Algerian Islamists and fight in Niger as mercenary; Foreign Ministry 15 Dec reportedly summoned French ambassador to convey “severe rebuke” to Paris for efforts to “destabilise” country. Resigning French FM Jean-Noël Barrot same day denied accusations, calling them “unfounded” and “fanciful”. Bilateral relations, under strain since Paris late July recognised Rabat’s sovereignty over disputed Western Sahara region, soured further after Nov arrest of Sansal; Tebboune 29 Dec gave speech criticising France for colonial legacy and backing of Morocco over Western Sahara issue, also called Sansal “impostor”. In other important international developments. Ukrainian intelligence services 18 Dec claimed Algerian mercenary recruited by Russian army killed in Ukraine.

Authorities, however, 16 Nov arrested French-Algerian author and govt-critic Boualem Sansal, reportedly on charges of “attacking the integrity of national territory”; Sansal 26 Nov appeared before public prosecutor who placed him in pre-trial detention. Ties with Morocco strained amid harsh rhetoric from Rabat. Moroccan King Mohammed VI 6 Nov adopted more offensive tone toward govt than usual during annual speech, describing Algiers’ support for referendum on Western Sahara self-determination as “disconnected from reality”; Moroccan FM Bourita 8 Nov accused govt of “wanting to start a war” against Morocco. Comments came in wake of Donald Trump’s U.S. election victory, as observers suggested Rabat may feel emboldened by return to power of ally who in 2020 recognised its claim over Western Sahara. Algiers strengthened relations with NATO and repaired Spain ties. NATO delegations 4-6 Nov visited capital Algiers, meeting Tebboune and other officials to discuss reinforcing cooperation and joint concerns including energy security.

Budget increase makes govt one of Africa’s largest arms spenders and comes amid rising tensions with Morocco over Western Sahara and insecurity along borders with Mali, Niger and Libya. Authorities may also be seeking to diversify arms supply, rather than relying so heavily on Russia, with Brazil, France, Italy and U.S. reportedly interested in making sales. Earlier, army Chief of Staff Said Chengriha 1-3 Oct visited Italy at invitation of Italian counterpart; parties announced intention to develop strategic military partnership.  Govt welcomed Western Sahara ruling but played down reports of tensions with Morocco. Foreign Ministry 5 Oct welcomed European Court of Justice ruling previous day that cancelled economic agreements between Morocco and EU for goods from disputed Western Sahara region (see Western Sahara); govt statement stressed illegality of trade agreement and “Sahrawi people’s inalienable rights over the natural resources contained in the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara”. In attempt to cool rising tensions with Rabat, President Tebboune in televised interview 7 Oct denied rumours authorities were expelling all Moroccans working in Algeria, saying Morocco is brotherly nation. Meanwhile, Tebboune 16 Oct announced second summit of new three-party grouping with Libya and Tunisia would take place in Libya “soon”; first summit held in Tunisia in April 2024."
Türkiye,December 2024,Ankara welcomed fall of Assad regime in Syria as Türkiye-backed forces pressed against Kurdish-led forces in Syria’s north east; military continued targeting Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in northern Iraq.,"Fall of Assad regime in Syria marked turning point for Ankara. Following dramatic collapse of House of Assad in Syria on 8 Dec (see Syria and Conflict in Focus), Ankara found its strategic position much improved: fall of Assad marked blow to Türkiye’s regional competitors Russia and Iran, reduced threat of refugee flows and boosted prospect of returning millions of Syrian refugees in Türkiye, and provided Ankara with potential to wield greater influence given its relations with Hei’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and armed groups that participated in offensive to topple Assad. Meanwhile, Ankara-backed local forces in Syria expelled U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces – led by PKK-affiliated People’s Protection Units (YPG) – from areas in north, raising prospect of further clashes (though U.S. brokerage halted advances as of 31 Dec).

Military continued strikes on PKK in Iraq and Syria after deadly PKK attack in Ankara in Oct that killed five and injured 22. Notably, military 22 Nov announced it neutralised nine PKK members in northern Iraq and northern Syria, including senior member. Meanwhile, speculation continued around details of possible new process between govt and PKK after President Erdoğan and his nationalist ally Devlet Bahçeli in Oct signalled willingness. Govt pressure on pro-Kurdish DEM party continued; notably, Ministry of Interior during Nov appointed trustees to five municipalities to replace elected DEM officials. Authorities continued crackdown on Islamic State (ISIS). Authorities during Nov detained some 77 individuals with suspected links to ISIS. Notably, police 6 Nov arrested three individuals for providing financial support to group in multi-province operation. Ankara monitored rebel advance in Syria’s north west. As rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied Turkish-backed factions 27 Nov launched major offensive against govt forces in Syria’s north west, FM Hakan Fidan 30 Nov remarked “Türkiye is not involved in the clashes” and “We will not engage in any action that might trigger a new wave of migration”; govt and Russia prepared counteroffensive and intensified airstrikes/shelling, which risks displacing hundreds of thousands of Syrians toward Turkish border (see Syria). Govt engaged Iraq and held high-level meeting in Greece. In second visit to Türkiye since 2022, Iraqi PM Mohammed Sudani 1 Nov met Erdoğan in Ankara, where pair reportedly discussed bilateral cooperation initiatives, including Development Road project. Meanwhile, Fidan and Greek FM Giorgos Gerapetritis 8 Nov met in Greece’s capital Athens and highlighted shared commitment to “positive agenda”, with Fidan advocating “win-win” approach to enhance security and prosperity for both nations; FMs also reportedly discussed how to build confidence and inch toward talks on delimitation of continental shelf and Exclusive Economic Zones in Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean, with further meetings scheduled for Dec."
Türkiye,October 2024,"Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) carried out attack in capital Ankara that killed five, prompting military to intensify airstrikes in northern Syria and northern Iraq; govt mulled new process to resolve conflict.","PKK killed five in Ankara, as govt considered new approach to Kurdish issue. Two attackers armed with assault rifles 23 Oct opened fire and detonated explosions at entrance of Turkish Aerospace Industries in Ankara, killing five and injuring at least 22; PKK 25 Oct claimed responsibility. In response, military targeted PKK and its Syrian affiliate in northern Iraq and northern Syria, respectively, hitting over 470 targets and “neutralising” 213 PKK members, according to President Erdoğan. PKK attack occurred just as govt appeared to test waters to see if new process to resolve four-decade conflict can be set in motion. Notably, Devlet Bahçeli, leader of the ultranationalist Nationalist Movement Party and President Erdoğan’s govt ally, in surprise statement 22 Oct said that authorities should give parole to imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan if he announces group’s dissolution; some media reports suggested that govt had facilitated contacts between imprisoned Öcalan and PKK leadership in Iraq, with Öcalan urging group to end its insurgency. Ankara 23 Oct permitted Öcalan’s nephew to visit him in prison, marking first such visit of family member in over three years. Erdoğan 30 Oct confirmed pursuit of new approach he described as “historic window of opportunity”, saying “My dear Kurdish brothers, we expect you to firmly grasp [Bahçeli’s] sincerely outstretched hand”.  Police continued operations against Islamic State (ISIS). Authorities during Oct detained some 300 individuals with suspected links to ISIS. Notably, operation 15-20 Oct spanning 23 provinces led to detention of 88 suspects.

Israel/Palestine,December 2024,"Humanitarian crisis spiralled in Gaza as Israel escalated siege in north amid onset of winter, while ceasefire talks again hit impasse; Trump administration in Jan could embolden Israel in Gaza, West Bank and against nemesis Iran.","Israel continued siege and depopulation campaign in northern Gaza. Israeli forces killed over 1,100 Palestinians across Gaza Strip in Dec, bringing official death toll since 7 Oct 2023 to at least 45,500 as of 31 Dec. Israel continued airstrikes and ground operations across strip and maintained siege, starvation and indiscriminate violence in northern Gaza, which aggravated dire humanitarian crisis and forced population displacement southward. UNRWA 1-10 Dec paused aid delivery through Kerem Shalom crossing, citing Israel’s failure to prevent looting. Israeli attacks escalated on and around Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia city in north, killing five medical staff and forcing medical workers and patients out. UN experts 30 Dec slammed Israel for “inflicting maximum suffering on civilians”. Qatari-mediated ceasefire talks reportedly restarted and made progress; Hamas appeared to compromise on demand for full Israeli withdrawal but PM Netanyahu asserted Israel will not end war and made new demand, insisting on list of all hostages ahead of deal. In West Bank, Palestinian Authority (PA) targeted armed groups, Israeli settler violence persisted. PA 5 Dec besieged Jenin refugee camp and 14 Dec launched operations against Jenin Brigades, killing at least eight, including four civilians, which stoked public anger. Meanwhile, Israeli raids, airstrikes and settler attacks continued, killing dozens throughout Dec. Settler leaders 15 Dec pressed Israeli cabinet to apply “northern Gaza model” to West Bank to expel large parts of Palestinian population; with new U.S. administration in Jan set to embrace Israel’s far-right ambitions, Israel could pursue de jure annexation of parts of West Bank and forcibly transfer thousands of Palestinians. Israel remained engaged in regional hostilities. Houthis intensified strikes on Israel, which launched waves of airstrikes (see Yemen); ceasefire with Hizbollah largely held despite violations (see Lebanon); following collapse of Assad regime in Syria, Israel occupied positions in and beyond UN buffer zone and decimated military infrastructure (see Syria and Conflict in Focus). Incoming Trump administration could embolden Israel to attack Iran’s nuclear sites (see Iran)."

Integrated Food Security Phase Classification 8 Nov warned that famine threshold in northern Gaza may have been crossed. UN official 12 Nov said conditions are “unfit for human survival”, as heavy rains late Nov increased hardship for over 1.6mn Palestinians in makeshift shelters. UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices 14 Nov reported Israel’s warfare in Gaza was “consistent with the characteristics of genocide”. Meanwhile, Hamas and other militants continued to battle Israeli forces, killing at least two dozen soldiers in north since Oct. Qatar 9 Nov suspended mediation efforts until parties show “willingness and seriousness” to end war. ICC 21 Nov issued arrest warrants for Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas military chief Mohammad Deif for crimes against humanity and war crimes from Oct 2023 until May 2024.  Israel mulled annexation of West Bank. Israel continued airstrikes and incursions in West Bank, bringing death toll since 7 Oct to over 760 Palestinians, as settler violence remained at historic highs. Election of former U.S. president Donald Trump buoyed annexation plans: Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich 11 Nov expressed hopes for annexation in 2025. Israel and Hizbollah agreed truce, Iran vowed retaliation. After expanded Israeli bombardment of Lebanon and Hizbollah counter-strikes, parties 26 Nov struck ceasefire (see Lebanon). Tehran continued to vow retaliation in response to Israel’s late-Oct airstrikes on its territory, which could trigger another cycle of destructive escalation (see Iran)."

In Beit Lahia city, Israeli strikes 19 Oct killed 87 Palestinians and 29 Oct killed over 90 sheltering in residential building. UN human rights chief 25 Oct warned of potential Israeli “atrocity crimes”, while UN’s acting under-sec for humanitarian affairs 26 Oct said “entire population of North Gaza is at risk of dying”. Israel appeared to use siege, starvation and violence to ethnically cleanse north and potentially lay groundwork for Israeli settlements – a strategy it could employ across Gaza Strip. In central and southern Gaza, Israeli strike 13 Oct killed 22, including 15 children, in school in Nuseirat camp; Israeli strike on al-Aqsa hospital next day burnt alive four civilians.

Rwanda,December 2024,Regional diplomatic efforts came to abrupt halt after significant setback of high-level Rwanda-DRC summit cancellation. ,"As Angola-facilitated meeting between leaders of Rwanda and DR Congo (DRC) collapsed, Rwandan-backed M23 rebels made gains on ground in eastern DRC (see DRC). High-stakes 15 Dec summit between Rwandan President Kagame and Congolese President Tshisekedi in Angola’s capital Luanda abruptly cancelled after breakdown in preparatory talks. Congolese govt 15 Dec accused Rwanda of introducing last-minute demand for Kinshasa to engage in dialogue with M23 rebels. Rwandan FM Olivier Nduhungirehe 15 Dec denied accusation, stating condition was introduced earlier by Angola’s facilitation, not Rwanda; same day claimed no reason to hold summit amid ongoing impasse over negotiating with M23, while Congolese govt accused Rwanda of “bad faith”. Angolan FM Téte António 18 Dec met Kagame in Rwanda’s capital Kigali, in attempt to bring Rwanda back to the negotiating table. Although Nduhungirehe said Rwanda willing to return to Luanda to sign peace agreement if “concrete and serious proposal for dialogue with M23 is presented”, Tshisekedi 20 Dec reaffirmed refusal to engage in direct talks with rebels. Escalating tensions threatened to undermine progress made on issues such as combating anti-Kigali armed group Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) in eastern DRC."

Rwandan FM Nduhungirehe and Congolese counterpart Wagner visited Congolese provincial capital Goma for ceremony, drawing sharp criticism from Congolese parliament head Vital Kamerhe and opposition members who accused govt of welcoming “aggressor”. Heightening tensions, Congolese Justice Minister Constant Mutamba during 24 Nov visit to Goma branded President Kagame “criminal” and offered financial reward for information leading to his arrest. Rwandan govt spokesperson Yolande Makolo same day condemned act as “extreme provocation” and 26 Nov warned against hate speech, accusing Mutamba of inciting violence and calling for killing of people of Rwandan origin. Despite tensions, Nduhungirehe and Wagner 25 Nov approved “concept of operations” document that will guide implementation of harmonised plan for Rwanda’s disengagement and neutralisation of FDLR. In other important international developments. Govt’s regional involvement continued to draw international scrutiny. EU Council 18 Nov pledged further €20mn to support Rwanda’s deployment in Mozambique; Belgium, however, abstained from voting on decision, expressly noting Rwandan military presence in DRC."
Rwanda,October 2024,Peace process with Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) faced challenges. ,"Angola attempted to invigorate Rwanda-DRC peace process amid doubts over feasibility. Angolan President Lourenço 11-12 Oct hosted fifth ministerial meeting between DRC and Rwanda in Angola’s capital Luanda, attended by Rwandan FM Olivier Nduhungirehe and Congolese counterpart Thérèse Wagner. FMs reiterated commitment to 4 Aug ceasefire, agreed on harmonised plan to neutralise anti-Kigali armed group Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) in DRC and tasked Angola with drafting Concept of Operations setting out implementation. Disagreements, however, continued over interpretations of plan’s reference to Rwandan troops in eastern DRC; Congolese PM Suminwa 17 Oct claimed Rwanda agreed to withdraw 4,000 troops but Nduhungirihe next day denied suggestion, labelling remarks as “unfounded”. Earlier, Kigali 5 Oct accused Kinshasa of delaying and refusing to sign agreement during mid-Sept meeting, while Wagner 8 Oct told UN major differences remained, citing disagreements over FDLR, justice mechanism and Rwanda’s rejection of clauses relating to its responsibility. Meanwhile, concerns rose that DRC may exit international peace process as Congolese President Tshisekedi 5 Oct did not join meeting with Rwandan counterpart Kagame at Francophonie Summit despite French President Macron’s efforts; Tshisekedi also absent from 8-10 Oct meetings between Congolese officials and new EU Special Envoy Johan Borgstam – appointed in July.
